# GenomeGPT

A learning project to implement a transformer network from scratch using **PyTorch**.  
As an initial experiment, I’m training it on DNA sequence data.  
Alongside the coding work, I’ll be exploring bioinformatics concepts, building on my background in cell biology from university.

## Goals
- Implement a simple transformer model in PyTorch trained on DNA sequences  
- Hopefully achieve prediction accuracy above random chance for the next base  
- potentially explore using codons (triplets) instead of single bases as model tokens
